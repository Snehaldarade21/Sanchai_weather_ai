# 🌦️ SanchAI Analytics – Weather AI Assistant

This project is a minimal full-stack web application built as part of the **SanchAI Analytics Internship Technical Assessment**.

The application allows users to ask weather-related questions (e.g., *“What’s the weather of Pune?”*).  
Behind the scenes, a **LangChain agent powered by OpenRouter LLM** detects the intent and uses a **weather tool** to fetch real-time weather data, which is then displayed on a React frontend.
